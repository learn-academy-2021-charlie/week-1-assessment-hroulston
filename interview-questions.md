# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a small coding machine that runs a block of code to create a result when called upon.

  Researched answer: Functions are self contained bits of code that accomplish a specific task. They take in data and then return a result. One of its best features is its reusability; this not only saves time and energy but produces cleaner more concise code.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is the place holder in a function indicated by parenthesis. An argument is what you put within the parenthesis when you call upon the function.

  Researched answer: The parameter is the variable that is found in the function definition. The argument is the actual value or input that is supplied when the function is called.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the place of an item. The value is what is at the index. For example: var hello = "hello". The value is "h" and its position is index 0.

  Researched answer: One of the best descriptions I found was as an example that an array is made of different boxes. The index is the number of the box we are interested in. What you find inside the box is the value.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in-method is code that holds pre built specifications or functionality that can be enacted on other items of code.  

  Researched answer: Built-in-methods deal with data and behavior. The built-in-method is used on a piece of data to create a certain pre-defined behavior. If the behavior requires any specifications then it is often supplied when implemented.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: When pair programming there is always a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person who is typing out the code and the navigator is telling the driver what to type while reviewing the code. In order for a pair programming session to be successful communication is essential. Both parties should be clear and specific as well as open to trying new ideas. Switching roles often is highly encouraged.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is when two programmers work together on a single project. There is a driver and a navigator (or observer). The navigator reviews as well as thinks about what direction they should be working in to achieve their goal. The driver should be able to focus on their task and rely on the navigator as their guide and second pair of eyes. This type of programming typically results in fewer defects.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programming was extremely helpful. Being able to discuss and communicate code to another person was vital in cementing what was learned in lecture. It was also a great opportunity to see how other people view the code and reiterate that there are different avenues to get to the same result.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Is a process where certain conditions are defined and when used it goes through lines of code over and over until the conditions are met.

2. Higher Order Functions: Functions that contain other functions within its argument when it is called or the output is another function.

3. Jest: Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript. In jest we have a describe method that holds what we are trying to test, the test method that explains in plain words what the test is doing, and finally the expect method which takes in what is expected to run. it is followed with a toBe or toEqual method that compares the outputs to ensure that they match

4. Classes: Classes provide the template for creating objects. They contain the data and the behavior.

5. React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is component based so you can start by making small parts and combining all of the small parts together to make an entire project.
